Please keep test support files organised in the following way to help
others maintain them.

Database fixtures go in a subdirectory of 't/fixtures', named after
the database e.g. for npgqc

./t/fixtures/npgqc/

Test data go in a subdirectory of './t/data', named after the harness
script e.g. for hts_file_data_object.t

./t/data/hts_file_data_object

Optionally, further data subdirectories may be created under this one,
named after individual test methods.

All paths must be lower case only, using underscores to replace camel-case
word boundaries. This way we can infer exactly where the data for a specific
test are located without having to search for it.
