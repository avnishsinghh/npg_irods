  abstract: 'The Middle East is a key area for understanding the evolutionary history of humans, and one of the most complex. It is one of the possible centres of the expansion of modern humans outside Africa and an established source of subsequent expansions such as that during the Neolithic into Europe and possibly North Africa. It is also likely to have experienced many less-understood migrations in several directions relevant to the history of Africa, Asia and Europe. Yet the genomics of populations in this area have been little-studied. In the current project, we propose to investigate the genomics of a Lebanese sample. We chose Lebanon because its history in the last few thousand years is relatively well-understood. In addition, our previous studies on the Lebanese population suggest Lebanon could have been a refuge for the earliest indigenous populations in the region. In this project we plan to (1) genotype 120 Lebanese individuals analyzing 2.5M variants (2) 8x sequence 100 individuals and (3) 30x sequence 4 individuals. '

  description: "we propose to investigate the genomics of a Lebanese sample. we plan (1) genotyping (2.5M) of 120 Lebanese individuals, choosing this platform to allow comparison with the 1000 Genomes and African Genome Variation project populations, (2) 8x sequencing of 100 individuals to provide unbiased population-level sequence information including allele frequencies, and (3) 30x sequencing of four individuals to allow inferences such as from PSMC/MSMC to be obtained. The current form is for the low-coverage sequencing.  \r\nThis data is part of a pre-publication release.
